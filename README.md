# AI Flappy Bird 
An AI-Evolved Flappy Bird Game using Python, Pygame, and NEAT

Welcome to AI Flappy Bird, a machine learning project where an AI learns to play Flappy Bird, better than any human could.
This was my first serious dive into applying neural networks and evolutionary algorithms in a hands-on game environment, and it turned out way cooler than I expected. 

## 🚀 About the Project

I built the entire Flappy Bird game from scratch using Python and Pygame, then trained an AI agent using neuroevolution and the NEAT algorithm to play the game.

The AI learns through trial and error—generation after generation, it gets better at dodging pipes and surviving longer. Eventually, the best agents were able to complete full runs of the game without failing.

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning Highlights

• 🐣 20+ generations trained through neuroevolution <br/>
• 📈 Survival rate increased by over 500% through iterative fitness-based selection <br/>
• 🧠 Neural networks evolve using the NEAT algorithm, optimizing both weights and architecture <br/>
• 🏆 Failure rate reduced to 0% with top-performing agents after tuning and evolution <br/> 

## 🎮 Features

• Fully playable Flappy Bird clone made with Python and Pygame <br/>
• Real-time AI decision-making powered by evolving neural networks <br/>
• Clean training loop that visualizes learning progress over time <br/>
• NEAT config customizable for experimenting with new setups and behaviors <br/>
• Lightweight and fast, runs locally on most machines <br/> 

## 🛠 Technologies Used

• Python <br/> 
• Pygame <br/> 
• NEAT-Python (for neuroevolution and network training) <br/>  

## 🌱 What's Next

In the future, I'd like to:

• Add difficulty scaling to push the AI even further <br/>
• Visualize neural network evolution with real-time graphs <br/>
• Build a dashboard to show more stats for each generation <br/>
