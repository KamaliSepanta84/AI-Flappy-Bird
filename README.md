# AI Flappy Bird 
An AI-Evolved Flappy Bird Game using Python, Pygame, and NEAT

Welcome to AI Flappy Bird, a machine learning project where an AI learns to play Flappy Bird, better than any human could.
This was my first serious dive into applying neural networks and evolutionary algorithms in a hands-on game environment, and it turned out way cooler than I expected. 

## ðŸš€ About the Project

I built the entire Flappy Bird game from scratch using Python and Pygame, then trained an AI agent using neuroevolution and the NEAT algorithm to play the game.

The AI learns through trial and errorâ€”generation after generation, it gets better at dodging pipes and surviving longer. Eventually, the best agents were able to complete full runs of the game without failing.
